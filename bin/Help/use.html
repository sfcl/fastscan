<hr />

<h2>How Do I Use It?</h2>
<p>There are several ways:</p>
<ul><li><p>The <b>easiest</b> is to double-click the CmdTwain icon on your
           desktop.</p>
        <p>This will scan a page to "C:\scanned_doc.jpg". You will need to move
           or copy the file somewhere else as it will be overwritten when you
           next double-click the icon.</p></li>
    <li><p>Start, Programs, CmdTwain, Scan to Desktop</p>
        <p>This scans a page and puts it on your desktop as "scan.jpg".</p></li>
    <li><p>Start, Programs, CmdTwain, Scan to Documents</p>
        <p>This is like the prior method but it names the scan "doc.jpg"
           and stores it in your Documents folder (called "My Documents" in 
           Windows XP).</p></li>
    <li><p>From your own programs.</p>
        <p>Run <code>"(install path)\CmdTwain.exe (options) (filename)"</code>.
           </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Don't forget that you can right-click a "Start, Programs, ..." choice and
   select "Send To, Desktop" if you prefer (for example) "Scan to Documents" as
   the icon on your desktop.</p>
<p>You can also drag the desktop icon to the "Quick Launch" bar (to the right
   of the Start button) to scan with a single click.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of files in your "Documents" folder you may want to create
   a "New Scans" subfolder. If you do this, you can right-click a desktop (or
   Programs) shortcut, choose "Properties" and update the "Target" setting to
   place scans in your subfolder.</p>

<h2>Are There Free Programs Available That Use It?  </h2>
<p>Yes. There are some free <a href="http://http://www.gssezisoft.com/main/category/support/cmdtwain_eg/">examples on the website</a>.
   If there is something else that you need, please <a href="http://www.gssezisoft.com/main/contact/">email me</a> and I'll see what I can do.</p>

<h2>What are the Standard Program Options?</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><td style="width:100px">Option</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tr><td>/PAPER=p</td>
    <td><p>How big.</p>
        <p>You can specify the size of the document to be scanned by using
        "/PAPER=p". In the above batch file I used /PAPER=A4 but you can also
        use LETTER, LEGAL, A3, A5, A6, B3, B4, B5, B6, C3, C4, C5, or C6. I use
        A4 even for smaller documents because all of my scans end up the same
        size when flicking through them and because I use JPG compression which
        means the files aren't much bigger with extra empty space.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>mode</td>
    <td><p>How much color.</p>
        <p>The possible modes are: /RGB for color, /GRAY for a grayscale or /BW
        for black and white.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>resolution</td>
    <td><p>How much detail.</p>
        <p>The resolution depends on your scanner but most will support lower
        resolutions (e.g. using a 1200 dots per inch scanner to do 200 DPI
        scans). Use /DPI=n to specify the scan resolution in dots per inch. The
        default is /DPI=200.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>format</td>
    <td><p>The format of the output file.</p>
        <p>This can be a bitmap file (*.BMP) or a JPG file with varying degrees
        of compression. Possible options for this are: /BMP, /JPG25, /JPG50,
        /JPG75 or /JPG.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>So, the command looks like: CmdTwain [paper] [mode] [resolution] [format] [path\]file</p>
<p>file should end in .jpg, .jpeg or .bmp</p>

<h2>What Other Options are Available?</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><td style="width:100px">Option</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>/SOURCE</td>
    <td><p>Select Scanner.</p>
        <p>This allows you to select which scanner you will be using.
        Normally, you will have a single scanning device attached to your
        system and this option is not needed. However, some people have
        multiple scanners, or image transfer devices that act like scanners. In
        those cases it can be necessary to select which device you want to scan
        from. To select a scanner device, run:</p>
        <p><code>CmdTwain /Source</code></p>
        <p>Once you have chosen a device, it will be used for all subsequent
        scanning - you don't need to choose it every time. You can run this
        command by choosing Start, Programs, CmdTwain, Select Source.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>/?</td>
    <td><p>Help.</p>
        <p>The /? option (<code>CmdTwain /?</code>) displays this help file.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>/WH w.w h.h</td>
    <td><p>Width and Height.</p>
        <p>This option allows you to change the scan size to non-standard or
        unsupported sizes. Some scanners don't support a full range of paper
        sizes. If yours doesn't accept /PAPER=p for a size you need, try this
        option. You can use /IN or /CM before /WH to use inches or
        centimeters.</p></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>How Do I Use It With A Program?</h2>
<p>Use system(), spawn(), Shell() etc, depending on your program's language, to run:</p>
<p><code>(InstallPath\)CmdTwain (options) (filename)</code></p>
<p>There are some <a href="http://www.gssezisoft.com/main/category/support/cmdtain_eg/">examples on the website</a>.</p>
<p>The default "(InstallPath\)" is "c:\Program Files\GssEzisoft\CmdTwain\".
   Don't forget that the operating system requires paths with embedded spaces to
   be quoted, eg: "c:\Program Files\fred.exe" not c:\Program Files\fred.exe as
   the later would attempt to run c:\Program</p>
