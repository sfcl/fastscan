<h1>Changes</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Ver 1.05, 10 Nov 2013</h2>
<p>Ignores any parameters which start with /sti. Windows adds two "/sti..."
   parameters if you run CmdTwain from the scanner button.</p>

<h2>Ver 1.04, 28 Jul 2013</h2>
<p>Added "/IN" "/CM" and "/WH w.w h.h" options.</p>
<p>Default install directory is now "C:\Program Files\GssEziSoft\CmdTwain".</p>

<h2>Ver 1.03, 29 May 2013</h2>
<p>The program runs in Win32 GUI mode again. This prevents an empty black window
   (Win32 console mode) appearing when the program runs.</p>
   
<h2>Ver 1.02, 10 Feb 2013</h2>
<p>This was an update to Ver 1.01 to get the DPI settings to "take". It involved
   a rewrite using MS Visual C++ 2010 and a more modern library (FreeImage).
   Earlier versions used Borland C++ and a very old version of the Intel JPEG
   library. CmdTwain now runs two subprograms.</p>
<p>The DPI setting is written to the file for both BMP and JPG formats.</p>
<p>"CmdTwain.exe /SOURCE" allows you to choose which TWAIN device to use.</p>
<p>The default install directory was "C:\Program Files\GssEziSoft\CmdTwain Free".</p>
<p>GssScan.bat is included.</p>
<p>Options are case insensitive.</p>

<h2>Ver 1.01, 19 Jan 2013, NOT RELEASED</h2>
<p>The DPI setting should have been written to the file for both BMP and JPG
   formats but the library used ignored the setting.</p>
<p>"CmdTwain.exe /SOURCE" allowed you to choose which TWAIN device to use.</p>
<p>As this was an update to Ver 0.03, options needed to be uppercase.</p>

<h2>Ver 1.00, 27 May 2009, NOT RELEASED</h2>
<p>This was an experimental version which was not released.</p>
<p>Options no longer needed to be specified in uppercase.</p>
<p>You could split the output path and filename into two separate parameters.
   This was useful for some programs.</p>
<p>The program supported quoted arguments. This is mainly useful for paths
   with spaces in them. e.g. "C:\Documents and Settings\...".</p>
<p>The GssScan.bat program was no longer needed (nor provided).</p>
<p>It supported autonumbering scans.</p>
<p>It included experimental support for document feeders. This feature was never
   tested.</p>

<h2>Ver 0.03, 14 Jan 2009</h2>
<p>This was supplied as an NSIS installer package. The default install
   directory was "C:\Program Files\Gss EziSoft\CmdTwain Free".</p>

<h2>Ver 0.02, 19 Nov 2007</h2>
<p>This was supplied as a ZIP file or as a self extracting archive. The
   self-extractor included an install.vbs file which simplified installation.
   Like its predecessor, it installed into "C:\Program Files\GssSoftware\CmdTwain"
   and included GssScan.bat in the "C:\Windows" directory.</p>

<h2>Ver 0.01, 29 Sep 2007</h2>
<p>This was a ZIP file. It installed into "C:\Program Files\GssSoftware\CmdTwain".
   It also provided GssScan.bat for the "C:\Windows" directory.</p>
